# WELCOME TO MY COVID-19 DATA EXPLORATION USING SQL
This project focuses on the Covid-19 virus, SQL is used to explore information about Covid-19 and its effects on human livess. The dataset used was gotten from ourworldindata.org which contained information about patients such as iso_code, continent, location, date, total cases, new cases,	new cases smoothed,	total deaths, new deaths, new deaths smoothed, total cases per million,	new cases per million, new cases smoothed per million,	total deaths per million,	new deaths per million,	new deaths smoothed per million, reproduction rate, stringency index, population density, median age,	aged 65 or older, aged 70 or older, gdp per capita,	extreme poverty, cardiovasc death rate,	diabetes prevalence, female smokers,	male smokers, handwashing facilities,	hospital beds per thousand,	life expectancy and population.

SQL queries were written to analyze important trends and patterns concerning the covid-19 epidemic which included but not limited to Death rate and vaccination rate. 

A new table containing information about continent, location, date, population, new vaccination and a rolling count of people vaccinated was created. SQL views were also created.

This project answered the following research questions-
1. What is the percentage chance of dying if infected by the Covid-19 disease?
2. What amount of population contracted the disease in each country?
3. Which countries recorded the highest amount of covid-19 infection rate?
4. Which countries had the highest death rate?
5. What is the difference between number of recorded cases and number of recorded deaths worldwide?
6. What is the vaccination rate in percent based on continent and location?

I hope you find this research helpful :D
