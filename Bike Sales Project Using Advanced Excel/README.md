**Brief Project Description:**
In this project, Excel functions were used to create a new column that categorized all customer into different demographic age groups which made it easier to track and monitor sales.

Pivot charts were created to visualize our sales trends and finally a dashboard was created by compiling all the charts together to tell a perfect story.

This project answered the following sales questions-
1. Which gender is more likely to buy more bikes?
2. Does income bracket of our customers affect our sales?
3. Does the commute distance of our customers enhance our sales?
4. Does personal factors such as marital status, children and Education level affect our sales?
5. Is location important when making sales?
