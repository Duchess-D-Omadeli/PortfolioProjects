In this project, we used python programming language to extract, clean, restructure and visualize an african food dataset. The dataset included information about each sale such as serial number,product name,product id, price, currency, state, country, month, year. After the cleaning process, i picked a particular interest in the market climate in Ghana.

This project focused on answering five important market research questions -

What are the different products sold in the ghana market?
Which market type is more saturated?
What is the number of sales of each product?
Which state recorded more sales?
What year recorded the most sales?
The answer to these questions can be used as a guide by any potential investor or businessman to determine what product and what location to invest into.

I genuinely hope you have found this project helpful.

Thank you for viewing :D
