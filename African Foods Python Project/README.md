**Brief Project Description**:

In this project, we used python programming language to extract, clean, restructure and visualize an african food dataset. The cleaned  dataset was saved into a new csv file. After the cleaning process, i picked a particular interest in the market climate in Ghana.

2. Which market type is more saturated?
3. What is the number of sales of each product?
