**Brief Project Description**
In this project, we used python programming language to extract, clean, restructure and visualize an african food dataset. The cleaned  dataset was saved into a new csv file. After the cleaning process, i picked a particular interest in the market climate in Ghana.

This project focused on answering five important market research questions -

1. What are the different products sold in the ghana market?
2. Which market type is more saturated?
3. What is the number of sales of each product?
4. Which state recorded more sales?
5. What year recorded the most sales?
