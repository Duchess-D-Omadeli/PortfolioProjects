# WELCOME TO MY AMAZON WEB SCRAPER PROJECT
NOTE: This project was creted for research purposes only. 

Series of codes were written using Python programming language and its libraries to collect data about a particular Jordan men sneakers. The information collected was the name, price and rating of the product, the date and time function was also used to record and create a date stamp for everytime data is collected. This information was used to create a very structured csv file that is saved directly into the computer's drive and can also be accessed offline.

The project was automated to collect and update new data about the product every 24 hours and automatically stores it into the csv file.

Lastly, a series of codes were written that allows the project to send a direct message to my personal e-mail account if the price of the sneakers fall below a set price of $348.

I hope you enjoy going through this project as much i have enjoyed creating it.

Thank you :D
