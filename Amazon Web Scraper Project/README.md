**Brief Project Description**: Series of codes were written using Python programming language and it's libraries to collect data about a particular Nike Jordan men sneakers. The information collected was the name, price and rating of the product, the date and time function was also used to record and create a date stamp for everytime data is collected. This information was used to create a very structured csv file that is saved directly into the computer's drive and can also be accessed offline.

The Application was automated to collect and update new data about the product every 24 hours and automatically stores it into the csv file.

Lastly, a series of codes were written that allows the application to send a direct message to my personal e-mail account if the price of the sneakers fall below a set price of $348.

**Result**- A fully functional automated python application that scrapes amazon's website every 24hours and collects information about a product and saves it directly into a offline csv file.
