# WELCOME TO SAN DIEGO AIRBNB TABLEAU PROJECT
In this project we explore the world of Airbnb in San diego, California. The dataset used for this project was gotten from kaggle.com and it contained information about each property and its hosts which include - id,	listing_url,	name, space,	description,	neighborhood_overview,	house_rules,	thumbnail_url,	host_id,	host_url,	host_name,	host_since,	host_location, host_about,	host_response_time,	host_response_rate,	host_acceptance_rate,	host_is_superhost,	host_neighbourhood,	host_listings_count,	host_total_listings_count,	host_has_profile_pic,	host_identity_verified,	street,	neighbourhood,	neighbourhood_cleansed,	city,	state,	zipcode,	market,	smart_location,	country_code,	country,	latitude,	longitude,	exact_location, property_type,	room_type,	accommodates,	bathrooms,	bedrooms,	beds,	bed_type,	review, square_feet,	price, price_per_stay,	security_deposit,	cleaning_fee,	guests_included,	extra_people,	minimum_nights,	maximum_nights,	number_of_reviews,	number_of_stays,	first_review,	last_review,	review_scores_rating,	review_scores_accuracy,	review_scores_cleanliness, review_scores_checkin,	review_scores_communication,	review_scores_location,	review_scores_value	requires_license,	instant_bookable,	is_business_travel_ready,	cancellation_policy,	require_guest_profile_picture	 and require_guest_phone_verification.

Important and Aesthetic appealing visualizations were created to study and understand the Airbnb market in San Diego using the information provided above. 

This project answered the following market research questions-

1. Which zipcode charges the highest price for Airbnb per night?
2. What neighbourhood has the most listing in San diego?
3. What room type makes the most amount of money?
4. What room type has the biggest market competition?

The answers to these question will guide a potential investor on his/her choice of location and type (how many bedrooms in a  house to be listed)  of Airbnb to open based on price they can charge, size of their competition in each market, and how well every house with a certain amount of bedrooms survive in the market.

I hope  you enjoy going through this project :D
